Review and customize the terraform.tfvars file with your AWS credentials and any other required variables.
Plan the Terraform execution to review the changes that will be applied:
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:
Copy code
terraform apply
Enter yes when prompted to confirm the execution.
Once the execution is complete, Terraform will output the details of the created resources.
